# ScanSpace

ScanSpace is the Android-first room-scanning and room-editing experience in the customer application. It uses real WebXR **CPU depth** frames when the device and browser expose them. It never represents ordinary camera permission as a depth scan.

## What is included

- WebXR depth capture with quality, point, and pose diagnostics.
- Privacy-preserving reconstruction: raw camera frames and raw depth frames are never uploaded. Optional sampled wall colour captures remain in the browser's IndexedDB store.
- An assisted AR-corner route when real depth is unavailable, plus a manual dimension route. Both remain visibly labelled as non-depth capture.
- A review step for room corners, wall dimensions, ceiling height, doors, and windows before the editor opens.
- A mobile 3D room editor with first-person movement, top/orbit modes, material changes, PBR lighting/shadows, GLB furniture, collision-aware movement and placement, undo/redo, and local save/load.
- Deterministic paint, floor-covering, and furniture estimates. The server recomputes all totals and verifies product price, availability, dimensions, and placement before returning cart lines.
- A project API with a local 256-bit owner key and 90-day automatic expiry. Users can only read or mutate projects created in that browser profile.

## Run locally

From the repository root, start the API in one terminal and the customer app in another:

```powershell
cd server
npm start

cd ..\customer
npm start
```

The customer app is available at `/scanspace`. Its development proxy sends `/api` requests to `http://localhost:5000`. Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` to the API origin when the two apps are hosted separately.

## Android depth test

Use a real Android device with a recent Chrome and a secure HTTPS deployment. The browser must have camera permission, and the server/static host must allow the `camera` and `xr-spatial-tracking` permissions. The development proxy sets:

```text
Permissions-Policy: camera=(self), xr-spatial-tracking=(self)
```

On the device, open **ScanSpace → Scan my room**, accept the camera prompt, and move slowly around the floor, walls, and ceiling. The Scan panel must show a non-zero depth-frame count, a depth format, and accumulating sampled points before the scan can be described as depth-backed. A healthy scan should cover each wall from multiple angles; sparse coverage intentionally stops at review instead of inventing missing geometry.

If the browser/device does not provide WebXR depth, use **Assisted AR corners** or **Enter dimensions manually**. Those routes still produce a usable editor, but are accurately labelled rather than advertised as depth scans. iOS is not part of this first release; evaluate AR Quick Look/RoomPlan/native capture as a separate platform track later.

## Catalog onboarding

Only products with `scanSpace.enabled: true` appear in the ScanSpace catalog. Configure their ScanSpace metadata through the product API/admin workflow; existing products remain compatible. A minimal paint product looks like:

```json
{
  "scanSpace": {
    "enabled": true,
    "materialType": "paint",
    "color": "#d9d2c3",
    "coveragePerLitre": 10,
    "defaultCoats": 2,
    "wasteFactor": 0.1
  }
}
```

Floor products use `materialType` of `tile`, `wood`, or `vinyl` and set `coveragePerPack` (plus `tileSize` where applicable). Furniture uses `materialType: "object"`, `dimensions` in metres, a placement type, and an HTTPS or local absolute `modelUrl` pointing to a GLB. The customer bundle ships three original placeholder GLBs in `customer/public/scanspace/models/` for the sample room only; they are not store inventory.

## Reservations/cart connection

`POST /api/scanspace/cart-lines` validates the final material selections on the server but intentionally returns an unreserved draft: this repository's customer checkout has no public stock-reservation endpoint yet. The customer app persists that validated draft locally and exposes `registerReservationCartAdapter()` in `customer/src/cart/reservationCart.js`. Connect that adapter to the real customer reservation/cart endpoint when it is introduced; only that endpoint should reserve stock or create a reservation.

## Saved rooms and cross-device loading

Cloud projects are private to the browser profile that created them. **Saved rooms** is available from both the ScanSpace start screen and the editor. It lists projects connected to the current browser and can open or delete them.

To continue a phone project on a PC, open **Saved rooms** on the phone, choose **Send to another device** beside the project, and share the generated link or 12-character code. On the PC, open the link or enter the code under **Open a room from your phone**. The code expires after one hour, works once, and copies the editable room into the PC browser's private project list. The source project stays on the phone.

The transfer includes the normalized room geometry, measurements, openings, finishes, placed products, and scan metadata. Captured camera textures and raw depth diagnostics remain on the scanning device and are never transferred.

## Deployment checklist

- Deploy the `customer` application as its own HTTPS static app with `npm run build`. The current root `render.yaml` does not deploy this customer application.
- Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` and allow the deployed customer origin in the API's CORS configuration.
- Configure the permissions-policy header shown above at the static host.
- Test a supported Android device end-to-end before advertising depth capture.
- Do not seed the sample products into production; onboard actual catalog data with real coverage, pack size, price, inventory, texture, and model metadata.

## Verification

```powershell
cd server
npm run test:scanspace

cd ..\customer
CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false --runInBand
npm run build
```
